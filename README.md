Take home assigment from Practice Fusion

==========Assignment Outline==========
Similar Doctors
Problem Statement
A site contains a listing of doctors. Users can browse for doctors given a specific specialty, area,
review score etc.
Write a simple web application which allows you to browse a list of doctors. When a doctor is
selected, display their details, along with a list of similar doctors, in a prioritized order. You
define what similar means and the result ordering, but clearly document any assumptions in
your code. You can assume the entire directory of doctors fits into memory.
Publish the web app on a public URL e.g. Heroku or Amazon S3 and submit the link along with
the code.
Aim to spend a maximum of 1.5hrs on this exercise. If applicable, note down any remaining
thoughts or things you would want to improve on with more time.


==========Things I would add given more time:==========
-Styleing
-A geolocator search to automatically display nearest Doctors to you via google geolocator API.
-Add a database and ability to add new doctors to the app.
-More navigation options

==========Concerns==========
I responded to the email I recieved with some questions about the assignment and never heard back.
I'm hoping that I guessed correctly that 'area' refered to the doctors' location (as in city/state 
or coordinates) and not something such as 'area of study'.
